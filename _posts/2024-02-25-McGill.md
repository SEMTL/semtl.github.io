 * **Erica De Petrillo** - *Automatic Generation of Projects for Model-Based Programming Courses*  
 > While learning by example can be very beneficial, providing students with complete working applications in model-based programming courses can be a real challenge due to time and resource constraints. The aim of the proposed FeatureLanguage is to completely generate the backend (i.e., Controller and Model) and the test suite of a Model-View-Controller (MVC) application suitable for a university course, as well as eventually also the View. The proposed FeatureLanguage is an extension of a domain model with a specification of the different features the application should be able to accommodate as well as constraints that need to be enforced.
 * **Fozail Ahmad** - *Hybrid Cloudification of Legacy Software for Efficient Simulation of Gas Turbine Designs*  
 > Title: Hybrid Cloudification of Legacy Software for Efficient Simulation of Gas Turbine Designs
Abstract: When developing aeroderivative gas turbines at Siemens Energy, engine models are subject to complex simulation campaigns for finite element analysis carried out by a legacy simulation tool. This paper presents results of a multi-year software modernization project to provide a software-as-a-service (SaaS) framework that enables the distributed and automated execution of simulation jobs over a hybrid cloud platform containing both private cloud and public cloud nodes. Our framework allows to significantly reduce the net time required for completing complex simulation campaigns, thus increasing the effectiveness of engineers. The performance of our framework is evaluated in various cloud configurations with complex simulation campaigns performed in the context of a real simulation task.

### Localisation

 > We are NOT in our usual location! The room is in *McIntyre Medical Building*. For those coming by metro, the closest station is **Peel**.
